    <h2>Gas Chromatography</h2>
    <p>Gas chromatography (GC) stands as a pivotal technique in forensic chemistry, offering a sophisticated means of separating and analyzing volatile compounds within complex mixtures. In forensic applications, GC plays a crucial role in the identification of substances found at crime scenes, aiding investigations through the precise analysis of trace evidence. By leveraging the principle of differential interaction between sample components and a stationary phase within a chromatograph, GC enables the separation of substances based on their unique chemical characteristics. This capability proves invaluable in forensic analyses, ranging from identifying illicit drugs and accelerants to analyzing bodily fluids or residues left at crime scenes. The sensitivity, speed, and accuracy of gas chromatography make it an indispensable tool for forensic scientists, contributing significantly to the resolution of criminal cases by providing crucial insights into the nature of evidence.</p>
